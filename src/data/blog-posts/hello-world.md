I am Naman. I have a YouTube channel and have also created multiple projects on my GitHub ranging from web3 to e-commerce to AI.

Through this blog I would like to keep a track of all the projects I have been making and also setup a place for myself to look back at articles and important <u>notes</u>.

Thank you and See you next time. ðŸ‘‹
